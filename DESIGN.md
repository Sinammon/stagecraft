# Heard design system

Heard is a browser-first speaking studio. The name and scalable speech-and-waveform mark draw on
the supplied brand reference. The interface is a focused workspace, with enough character to feel
welcoming and enough restraint to keep attention on the user's talk.

## Information architecture

- **Home** (`#home`): one promise, one topic launcher, a three-step overview, an illustrative review
  explorer, and a compact FAQ. No testimonials, invented results, or duplicate promotional CTAs.
- **Our approach** (`#about`): preparation, observable feedback, evidence, and plain-language privacy.
- **Studio** (`#studio`): three progress stages — Prepare, Practice, Review. Preparation offers manual
  writing and Gemini drafting. Practice includes device selection, seated/standing posture,
  optional calibration, required AI consent, adaptive talking-point cards after a first read-through, and recording. Review has Listen, Watch, and Reflect
  modes for audio-only, muted video, and combined playback with coaching.

Home, approach, and studio sit on one scrolling page. Sticky hash navigation scrolls without
unmounting the studio, including during recording. Studio workflow changes preserve draft/review state. The old draft storage key is deliberately retained for existing users.

## Identity

- Name: **Heard**; wordmark: lowercase **heard**, Geist 750 with tight tracking.
- Mark: two speech frames enclosing five sound bars. Flat orange, scalable SVG, no raster dependency.
- Assets: `src/brand.js`, `public/heard-mark.svg`, `public/favicon.svg`.
- Canvas: `#faf9f6`; text: `#252622`; secondary text: `#6e7068`.
- Accent: `#ec572e`, used for the mark and small visual details.
- Serif accent text: `#a94a2b`; the hero mark has no surrounding card, border, or background.
- Surfaces: white and `#f3f2ee`; borders: `#eaeaea`; evidence/score tint: `#edf2e9`.
- Errors: `#a53227` on `#fcece6`.

## Typography and components

Self-hosted Geist handles UI, forms, and feedback. Instrument Serif handles public page headlines,
illustrative excerpts, and preparation guidance. No remote font calls. Headings use tight tracking;
body text uses an 18px base and 1.65 line height. Secondary text stays at least approximately 15px. Public headlines have at most two deliberate lines on desktop.

Primary actions are charcoal with white text and 6px corners. Secondary actions are white with a
quiet border. Panels use 1px structural borders, 10px corners, and generous internal space. There
are no gradients or heavy shadows. Phosphor Bold SVG icons are bundled individually.

The script editor is the largest preparation surface. Guidance is secondary and removed on narrow
screens. Setup puts required AI consent before the mirrored camera and optional posture calibration. A confirmed read-through or first recorded take creates 3–8 AI talking-point cards; the next take shows cards with the full script available in a disclosure. Recording puts Finish
practice next to the timer. Reviews keep playback, measured data, evidence, and feedback together.
Unavailable measurements stay explicit; illustrations never masquerade as live results.

## Interaction and accessibility

- A page-wide skip link, semantic section navigation, and labeled form inputs.
- Visible focus, arrow/Home/End keyboard behavior for script and review-example tabs.
- Short status messages, persistent errors, disabled actions while work is in progress.
- Unchecked AI consent by default; provider data-use disclosure beside the required consent checkbox. Devices and recording are disabled until consent and AI availability are confirmed.
- Muted video-only playback remains enforced. Full video stays local.
- Responsive layouts from 320px to desktop; supported recording remains desktop Chromium.
- Below-the-fold public sections reveal once through IntersectionObserver. Reduced motion bypasses
  entrance transitions and animated spinners. Camera overlays use opaque backgrounds, including
  reduced-transparency preference support.

## Scope

This redesign changes branding, layout, navigation presentation, and copy. It adds a bounded, consent-checked `/api/flashcards` route and requires configured AI for session creation. Scoring, recording limits, quota rules, session ownership, and deployed backend lifecycle remain unchanged.
No public deployment is performed by the redesign.
